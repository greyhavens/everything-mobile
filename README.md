This is a mobile client for [The Everything Game] built with [PlayN], and which is shipped on iOS
and [Android].

Unfortunately, when I updated the game for iOS 9, I lost the reviewer lottery and got a reviewer
who decided that it violated copyright. The game contains thousands of images as part of its series
of cards for "everything" and many of those series were created by player volunteers. Though said
players were hopefully following guidelines which stated that all images must come from public
domain or creative commons licensed sources, that was hardly something I had the time or
inclination to fight Apple about, since only a handful of people even play the game any more. So no
iOS version. Boo hoo.

Source for the [server and web client] are also hosted on Github.
